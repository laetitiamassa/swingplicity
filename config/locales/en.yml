    max_1: "Maxence Martin is one of the WOTP organizers but he most importantly is the first french dancer to obtain the West Coast Swing Champion title."
    max_2: "Ex-Champion of judo and black belt, he started his dance career in Lindy-Hop. He quickly fell in love with WCS and started his training in 2007 with the greatest in California. In less than one year, he would confirm his status of Champion."
    max_3: "Since then, he has been traveling all over the world to share his knowledge and his passion for this dance."
    max_4: "Maxence is one of the most talented, appreciated and kind dancer of his generation, and especially one of the most social."
    virg_1: "Virginie began her dance training when she was only five years old. Beginning with rock'n'roll and boogie, she moved to individual dances, like modern jazz, classical and contemporary dance. She studied at the National Superior Dance Conservatory and succeeded in the technical final exam. She discovered West Coast Swing in 2007 and since then has been growing very quickly in the community, thanks to her previous training and her natural talent for this dance."
    virg_2: "Virginie Grondin is one of the best West Coast Swing dancer in Europe right now, and she is dancing amongst Champions in the US."
    max_virg: "Maxence and Virginie started their great partnership in 2012 . For two years, they have placed in the top 10 finalists at the biggest international competition in the Classic division at US Open."
    max_virg1: "They are back for the second year at Swingplicity Brussels."

    prof_title_2: "Stanley Seguy et Maïna Vila Cobarsi"
    stan_1: "As far back as he can remember, Stanley has always loved dancing and moving to music, whether solo or with others. He started couple dancing with salsa and rock'n'roll."
    stan_2: "He discovered West Coast Swing in 2009 and fell in love with the elegance, fluidity of this dance. He is teaching regular West Coast Swing classes in Rouen (France). Stanley has studied with Maxence Martin and has also obtained his Professional Dance Instructors Association certified by Mr Robert Royston."
    stan_3: "He is a renowned and well respected dancer, and having competed in some of the most prestigious event in Europe and US has now reached the final level : All Star."
    stan_4: "With his very friendly and sociable approach, Stanley is a well sought after teacher and judge, and wants to help people to share his passion for dance in both simplicity and feel.   His purpose is to impart his knowledge with good humour and to help take people to the next level."
    col_1: "Maïna a découvert le West Coast Swing en 2013 et est restée sous le charme de cette danse de couple fluide et élégante. Elle s’est alors formée auprès de Stanley et s’inspire de grandes championnes telles que Virginie Grondin et Torri Smith."
    col_2: "En 2014, elle a commencé les compétitions, dont les plus grandes, et a convaincu les juges par son style élégant et sexy. Sa première place au Budafest 2016 lui a récemment ouvert les portes de la catégorie Avancé."
    col_3: "Maïna a eu l’opportunité d’assister Stanley et Browly, deux all star reconnus, lors de sessions à Paris et de donner quelques stages. Elle aime partager sa passion avec sincérité pour aider les danseurs et danseuses à s’amuser davantage sur la piste. "

    prof_title_3: "Miguel Ortega & Angélique Pernotte"
    miguel_1: "In 2006 Miguel discovered he can actually dance. He started by training as a ballroom dancer and he later on switched to latin dances (cuban salsa, portorican salsa on 1/on 2, bachata). He joined an amateur salsa group and continued improving his skills by participating in numerous international congresses."
    miguel_2: "Eventually he got irreversibly infected by the West Coast Swing virus. Miguel particularly enjoys the musicality, the creativity and the social nature of this modern dance that he is still very much in love with."
    miguel_3: "Miguel is always up for new challenges. He joined the All Star Division of West Coast Swing dancers and he won the 4 th place with a Classic routine at the French Open when he danced together with Emmeline Rochefeuille. All these experiences made him improve his skills and become a better dancer. Now he wants to share his passion for the WCS by teaching."
    angi_1: "Angie started dancing modern jazz and classical when she was only 4 years old. Very soon afterwards she got interested in couples dancing. She started with acrobatic rock and roll and did competitions for 3 years."
    angi_2: "She discovered West Coast Swing in 2010. She particularly enjoys the fluidity, the smoothness and the technique of this dance. Angie started competing in Europe and joined the Advanced division of WCS dancers in 2015 when she won several first prizes in different international events with a Classic routine."
    angi_3: "It has now been two years since she started teaching in two dance schools in Lyon, France. She gives lady styling classes and aims to further develop this wonderful dance."
