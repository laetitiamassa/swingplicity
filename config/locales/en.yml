    max_4: "Maxence is one of the most talented, appreciated and kind dancer of his generation, and especially one of the most social."
    virg_1: "Virginie began her dance training when she was only five years old. Beginning with rock'n'roll and boogie, she moved to individual dances, like modern jazz, classical and contemporary dance. She studied at the National Superior Dance Conservatory and succeeded in the technical final exam. She discovered West Coast Swing in 2007 and since then has been growing very quickly in the community, thanks to her previous training and her natural talent for this dance."
    virg_2: "Virginie Grondin is one of the best West Coast Swing dancer in Europe right now, and she is dancing amongst Champions in the US."

    stan_2: "He discovered West Coast Swing in 2009 and fell in love with the elegance, fluidity of this dance. He is teaching regular West Coast Swing classes in Rouen (France). Stanley has studied with Maxence Martin and has also obtained his Professional Dance Instructors Association certified by Mr Robert Royston."

    stan_4: "With his very friendly and sociable approach, Stanley is a well sought after teacher and judge, and wants to help people to share his passion for dance in both simplicity and feel.   His purpose is to impart his knowledge with good humour and to help take people to the next level."
    col_1: "Coleen Man found West Coast Swing back in 2010 and hasn’t looked back since.  She is now one of the top ranked West Coast Swing Dancers in the UK, after quickly rising up the ranks, she is now competing in WSDC Allstar Division. She studied with the renowned Paul Warden,  and has since been competing all over the world.  She teaches regular classes in the UK and now is making her mark in Europe both as a teacher and a judge."
    col_2: "Her love of dancing did not start with West Coast Swing, Coleen has made dance her life and from a young age she took Ballet, Tap and Jazz lessons.  She has gone on to become a registered teacher of the Royal Academy of Dance, the most prestigious ballet organisation in the world, and now runs her own Dance school in the UK."

    prof_title_3: "Miguel Ortega and Angélique Pernotte (France)"
    miguel_1: "Miguel découvre qu'il peut bouger en rythme en 2006. Après les danses de salons, il tomba amoureux de danses latino ( salsa cubaine, portoricaine on1/on2, bachata). Il rejoignit un troupe de salsa amateur pour continuer à se former en participant à plusieurs congrès internationaux."
    miguel_2: "Il finit par tomber inéluctablement malade du virus du WCS, dont la musicalité, créativité et surtout, l'esprit social, le gardent complétement amoureux depuis."
    miguel_3: "Toujours à la recherche de nouveaux challenges, il atteint la catégorie All-Star et décide de faire une routine en catégorie Classic avec Emeline Rochefeuille (4ème place au French Open). Fort de ces expériences, il souhaite maintenant continuer dans l'enseignement pour partager sa passion du WCS."
    angi_1: "Angy a commencé la danse à l'age de 4 ans par du modern jazz, classique puis s'est vite intéressée aux autres danses de couples comme le rock sauté qu'elle a pratiqué pendant 3 ans en compétition."
    angi_2: "C'est en 2010 qu'elle découvre le WEST COAST SWING, une danse pleine de douceur, de fluidité et de technique qui l'a très vite passionnée. Elle a commencé à faire des compétitions à travers l'Europe et s'est très rapidement retrouvé en catégorie Advanced en 2015. Une année qui fut couronnée par 5 premières place en catégorie Classic dans plusieurs événements internationaux. "
