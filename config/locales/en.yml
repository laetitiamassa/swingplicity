Beginning with rock'n'roll and boogie, she moved to individual dances, like modern jazz, classical and contemporary dance. She studied at the National Superior Dance Conservatory and succeeded in the technical final exam. She discovered West Coast Swing in 2007 and since then has been growing very quickly in the community, thanks to her previous training and her natural talent for this dance."
